Starting with 5, every second Fibonacci number is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with integer sides, or in other words, the largest number in a Pythagorean triple. The length of the longer leg of this triangle is equal to the sum of the three sides of the preceding triangle in this series of triangles, and the shorter leg is equal to the difference between the preceding bypassed Fibonacci number and the shorter leg of the preceding triangle.
The first triangle in this series has sides of length 5, 4, and 3. Skipping 8, the next triangle has sides of length 13, 12 (5 + 4 + 3), and 5 (8 − 3). Skipping 21, the next triangle has sides of length 34, 30 (13 + 12 + 5), and 16 (21 − 5). This series continues indefinitely. The triangle sides a, b, c can be calculated directly:
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a_{n}&=F_{2n-1}\\[4pt]b_{n}&=2F_{n}F_{n-1}\\[4pt]c_{n}&=F_{n}^{2}-F_{n-1}^{2}.\end{aligned}}} {\begin{aligned}a_{n}&=F_{2n-1}\\[4pt]b_{n}&=2F_{n}F_{n-1}\\[4pt]c_{n}&=F_{n}^{2}-F_{n-1}^{2}.\end{aligned}}
These formulas satisfy {\displaystyle a_{n}^{2}=b_{n}^{2}+c_{n}^{2}} a_{n}^{2}=b_{n}^{2}+c_{n}^{2} for all n, but they only represent triangle sides when n > 2.
Any four consecutive Fibonacci numbers Fn, Fn+1, Fn+2 and Fn+3 can also be used to generate a Pythagorean triple in a different way:[52]
{\displaystyle a=F_{n}F_{n+3}\,;\,b=2F_{n+1}F_{n+2}\,;\,c=F_{n+1}^{2}+F_{n+2}^{2}\,;\,a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\,.} a=F_{n}F_{n+3}\,;\,b=2F_{n+1}F_{n+2}\,;\,c=F_{n+1}^{2}+F_{n+2}^{2}\,;\,a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\,.
Example 1: let the Fibonacci numbers be 1, 2, 3 and 5. Then:
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}a=1\times 5&=5\\b=2\times 2\times 3&=12\\c=2^{2}+3^{2}&=13\\5^{2}+12^{2}&=13^{2}\end{aligned}}} {\begin{aligned}a=1\times 5&=5\\b=2\times 2\times 3&=12\\c=2^{2}+3^{2}&=13\\5^{2}+12^{2}&=13^{2}\end{aligned}}
